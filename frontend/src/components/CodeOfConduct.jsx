      <h2>League Rules</h2>
        <h3>
          <a href="https://usaultimate.org/rules/">USA Ultimate Rules of Play 2024-2024</a>
        </h3>
          <li>DiscNY uses USAU’s official Rules of Play for the HSL as a baseline, with certain modifications for youth play and league purposes.</li>
        <h3>Rule alterations/specifications for the DiscNY HSL</h3>
          <ol>General length of Games (regular season)</ol>
            <li>All games are played to 15.</li>
            <li>All games have a soft cap at 90 minutes.</li>
            <li>All games have a hard cap at 105 minutes.</li>
            <li>All games have a halftime cap at 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Halftime is a maximum of 10 minutes long.</li>
            <li>After a goal is scored, the next pull should go up within 2 minutes.</li>
          <ol>Shortened Games (the “I’m playing the MTA card” rule): If captains and coaches from both teams agree that a game started late from circumstances beyond either team’s control (traffic, natural disaster, the MTA, etc), they may agree to use the following shortened game length.</ol>
            <li>Game played to 13</li>
            <li>Soft cap at 75 minutes</li>
            <li>Hard cap at 90 minutes</li>
            <li>Halftime cap at 40 minutes</li>
            <li>Halftime is a maximum of 7 minutes long.</li>
            <li>After a goal is scored, the next pull should go up within 2 minutes.</li>
          <ol>HSL Playoff games (semis and finals in all divisions)</ol>
            <li>Games will be played to 15</li>
            <li>Games have a soft cap at 90 minutes and no hard cap</li>
            <li>Games have a halftime cap at 45 minutes</li>
            <li>Halftime is a maximum of 10 minutes long</li>
            <li>After a goal is scored, the next pull should go up within 2 minutes.</li>
          <ol>If regular season games cannot be played per 5.b.i or 5.b.ii, teams should reschedule their game for a later date. If a game is played per 5.b.ii, it must be communicated to the league’s leadership.</ol>
          <ol>Captain’s clause</ol>
            <li>A game may be played under any variation of the rules agreed upon by the coaches & captains of the teams involved. In tournament play (including the HSL postseason), variations are subject to approval by the event organizer. Such things as game length, field dimensions, number of players and stall count can easily be altered to suit the level of play. Before a game starts, each team designates one captain to represent them in disagreements and arbitration.</li>
            <li>This may include things like banning zone defense in a B-league game, shortening games for time reasons, etcetera.</li>
          <ol>Spirit and Spiking</ol>
            <li>The DiscNY High School League is a NO spiking league.</li>
            <li>Teams are encouraged to have spirit captains as defined by USAU’s <a href="https://usaultimate.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Spirit-Captain-Guide-FINAL-VERSION.pdf">Spirit Captain Guide</a></li>
            <li>A Spirit Score (0-20) will be given to each team at the end of games and will follow the USAU/WFDF spirit rubric.</li>
            <li>If a team is consistently in violation of the rules or of the spirit of the game, opposing team captains/coaches should stop play using a spirit timeout to discuss and resolve any violations of Spirit immediately.</li>
              <ul>If this occurs during a league game, teams should also follow up with hsleague@discny.org.</ul>
            <li>Teams must average a minimum spirit score of 8.00 on the season in order to qualify for playoffs</li>
            <li>Spirit Circles - Teams are encouraged to hold spirit circles after every game.</li>
            <li>On Spirit of the Game definitions and their inherent issues:</li>
              <ul>We as a league recognize the tone-policing and white supremacist language written into USAU’s definition of Spirit of the Game, particularly in the examples of positive spirit. We believe in the importance of Spirit in our youth league, and we also believe that Spirit’s definition needs to be updated to remove this problematic language.</ul>
            <li>The HSL definition of Spirit of the Game</li>
              <ul>We believe that parts of the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/rules/#2">USAU Definition of Spirit</a> are worth using for this league.</ul>
              <ul>We choose to stick with the definition as per 2.A-C.1, 2.F.1-2, 2.F.5-7, and 2.G-K.2</ul>
              <ul>All those involved in the league must understand the rules of the game and play by those rules. Where disputes arise, it is the responsibility of those involved to agree on an outcome.</ul>
        <h3>Uniform Guidelines</h3>
          <ol>Teams are encouraged to abide by the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v-QUc0PEd0GNA_G3YMyCqWYhGKiKvWxCeVNXiVt-H0M/edit">HSL Uniform Guidelines</a> While these are not requirements for the 2024 season, they may become so for 2025 and beyond.</ol>
        <h3>Forfeit Rules</h3>
          <ol>Teams will be considered to have forfeited a game if:</ol>
            <li>They do not notify their opponents of their intent to reschedule by 2:00 pm the day before their originally scheduled game.</li>
            <li>A team arrives or will arrive more than one (1) hour past the scheduled start time of their scheduled game if they have not communicated with their opponents to notify them of their late arrival and agreed that it is acceptable.</li>
            <li>A team cannot field at least 8 players at the game as scheduled.</li>
            <li>Teams cannot reschedule their game within the confines of the regular season schedule. Preference is that teams reschedule their games for a date within 10 days of the originally scheduled game.</li>
          <ol>A forfeit win is counted towards the number of games played to qualify for playoffs and as a 1 - 0 win for point differential, but does not count as a "win" towards head-to-head.</ol>
          <ol>A forfeit loss is counted towards the number of games played to qualify for playoffs and as a 0 - 1 loss for point differential, but is not counted as a “loss” towards head-to-head.</ol>
          <ol>When determining playoff qualification, forfeit wins and losses will be ignored in a team’s record, but the 1 - 0 or 0 - 1 point differential will be used to break ties as needed.</ol>
          <ol>Should both teams be unable to play the game as scheduled and unable to reschedule the game, it will be considered a double forfeit with a score of 0 - 0.</ol>
        <h3>Late/Travel Policy</h3>
          <ol>If a team is late without warning to arrive at a field site based on the agreed upon start time, the team already at the field may assess points at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes after a twenty minute grace period if they choose to. Teams should try to be as understanding as possible given the difficulties of commuting in New York City.</ol>
            <li>This does not apply if teams have agreed to start a game late due to traffic or other New York City commute problems.</li>
            <li>If a game’s score reaches 8-0 based on points assessed for lateness, it is considered a forfeit per 5.c.i.2</li>
        <h3>Roster Limits</h3>
          <ol>Each team’s roster must have at minimum 10 players, 1 coach, and 1 chaperone per 3.b.ii - 3.b.vi</ol>
          <ol>Presently, there is no maximum roster limit</ol>
        <h3>Non-school Participant(s) aka “Free Agents”</h3>
          <ol>Each team is allowed a maximum of 2 non-school participants (“Free Agents”), as long as the non-school participant(s) do not have a league team at their present school. All HSL Officers must be notified of Free Agent additions and will be allowed at their discretion.</ol>
            <li>Free Agents may not compete in league games until HSL Officers make a decision concerning their participation.</li>
          <ol>This restriction does not apply to teams in the Club Girls & Nonbinary Division</ol>
          <ol>With regard to the future of the Free Agents policy:</ol>
            <li>The DiscNY HSL Officers are in the process of drafting a larger overhaul of the Free Agents policy for the league based on feedback from HSL coaches and an intent to be in alignment with neighboring Disc orgs’ policies. For the 2024 season, the above regulations will be enforced as written. For 2025 and beyond, teams can expect updated policy with more specific and comprehensive language, in line with policies in use by other Disc Associations in their own leagues</li>
            <li>It is the position of the DiscNY HSL that until the Club Girls and Nonbinary division has enough stable year-to-year team participation, the Free Agents policy must be enforced differently or not at all in this division.</li>
          <ol>Weather Policy - The following policies are taken from the <a href="https://usaultimate.org/resources/organizer_resources/health_safety_and_liability_requirements.aspx">USA Ultimate's Weather Policy</a>(Schools may have their own policy.)</ol>
            <li>Lightning - Flash-to-Bang. Begin counting when a lightning flash is sighted.  Stop counting when the associated thunder is heard. Divide the count by five to determine how far away the lightning is. 30 seconds equals about six miles.  Lightning has been known to strike from as far away as 10 miles, even under clear skies.</li>
            <li>By the time the Flash-to-Bang count has reached 30 seconds, all individuals should be in a safe shelter location. Wait at least 30 minutes after the last flash of lightning or sound of thunder before resuming play.</li>
          <ol>For Extreme Heat and Cold:</ol>
            <li>When the Heat Index reaches 100F (see NOAA/National Weather Service Heat Index Chart), play must be suspended.  In colder temperatures and/or wetter conditions, it is important to be cognizant of conditions conducive to hypothermia. When the Wind Chill Temperature drops to or is below 32F (see NOAA/National Weather Service Wind Chill Chart), play must be suspended.</li>
          <ol>Play may also be suspended at the discretion of both coaches and/or the League Officers.</ol>
          <li></li>
